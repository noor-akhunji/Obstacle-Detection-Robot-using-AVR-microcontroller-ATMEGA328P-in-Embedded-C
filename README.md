# Obstacle Detection and avoidance Robot using AVR microcontroller ATMEGA328P in Embedded C

Introduction:

The field of robotics has witnessed advancements, with the time in autonomous car. The development of obstacle detection and avoidance systems for driverless cars is one of the main applications. This report describes the design and development of an Arduino-based obstacle detection and avoidance car. The goal of this project is to develop an autonomous car that can intelligently recognize and avoid obstacles while navigating through its surroundings.
For this course work-mini project I used Ultra-sonic Sensor, Servo, Led, Buzzer, Potentiometer, DC motors and L298N H-bridge motor driver.

Components used in project:

1 x Arduino Uno (AtMega328p)

1 x Breadboard

1 x Ultra-sonic Sensor

1 x SG-90 Servo motor

1 x L298N H-bridge motor driver

1 x Buzzer

1 x Potentiometer

1 x 9v Battery

2 x Led

2 x DC motors

2 x wheels
